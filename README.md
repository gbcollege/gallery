# Gallery of Squares

Create a 4 column gallery that displays each of the images cropped inside of an exact square

1. If the width of the image is bigger than the height, apply the .landscape class
2. If the height of the image is bigger than the width, apply .portrait class
3. In both cases then center then exactly center the images inside of their .galimg container
4. When the page gets resized, recalculate the size of the squares
5. When an image is clicked, fade in a modal and show a full screen version of the image
  - Do you want to expand the current image? Or make a duplicate?
6. Add the caption from the image to the screen (dynamically, using jQuery)
